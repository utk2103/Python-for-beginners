# Why: Demo for function and input/output
def func1():
    # Why: Placeholder function for structure
    # utka
    # utkasfjh
    # jlfdjlj
    # jrlfjl
    print(func1)


# Why: Show input/output in terminal
# Make vs code compatible to take the input
# make changes in code runner through settings -> run in terminal 
# -> Clear previous output
# -> Save file before run
print("Hello world")
a = input("Enter a number\n")
print ("Your number is: ", a)


# Why: List and loop example
# use of alt+ shift or alt + select to add changes at various places at once
